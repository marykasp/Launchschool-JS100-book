function scream(words) {
  return words + '!!!!';
}

scream('Yipeee') // nothing is logged to the console since the function does not contain console.log

// Instead when you call the sream function it adds exclamation points to the word you pass in as argument and returns that concatenated string, in this case it is not stored to a variable or logged to the console
